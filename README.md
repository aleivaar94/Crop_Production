THIS or THAT?

Grouped bar charts are great for comparing categories and subcategories, showing differences within and across groups.

However, when there are many categories it becomes too cluttered and the differences cannot be seen easily.

In this case, a better alternative is to use a bubble chart. The bubble size adds a dimension and helps to show the differences in magnitude.
